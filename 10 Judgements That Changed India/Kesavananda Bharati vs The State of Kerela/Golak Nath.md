This issure was yet again raised in <i>I. C. Golak Nath v. State of Punjab</i>.<br>
Challenged the validity of First, Fourth and Seventeenth Amendments.<br>
Constituted an 11-judge bench.<br>
Slender majority of 6:5.<br>
Supreme Court ruled that the distinction between constituent power and legislative power laid down in <i>Shankari Prasad</i> was unfounded.<br>
Court found fundamental rights to be so sarcosant and transcendental that even unanimous vote of Parliament would not be sufficient to weaken them.<br>
Court asserted that fundamental inviolable and admitted that applying decision across board would be chaotic.<br>
Decided to move with American doctrine of 'Prospective Overruling'.<br>
This further means that its decision would apply only to subsequent constitutional amendments.<br>
So, petitioners in <i>Golak Nath</i> got no relief.<br>
In <i>Golak Nath</i>, Supreme Court, for the first time, based decision purely on political philosophy.<br>
With the 24<sup>th</sup> Amendment, the Parliament nullified the Court's decision in <i>Golak Nath</i>.<br>
This further ensured that constitutional amendments could not be reviewed by courts even if they violated fundamental rights.<br>
